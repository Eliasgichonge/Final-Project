# üöó Lane Departure Detection System using OpenCV and Kalman Filter

A real-time lane departure warning system built with Python, OpenCV, Kalman filtering, and an ESP32 camera. This system detects white lane markings, tracks their positions over time using a Kalman filter, and triggers an audio alarm when the vehicle veers out of its lane.

## üìå Features

- üì∑ **Real-Time Video Streaming** from ESP32-CAM module.
- üõ£Ô∏è **Lane Detection** using multi-color space thresholding and edge detection.
- üìà **Lane Position Smoothing** with Kalman Filter for stability.
- üö® **Audio Alarm** system using `pygame` for lane departure warnings.
- üß† **Multiple Detection Techniques**: Histogram analysis, contours, Hough lines.
- üîÅ **Violation Tracking** to reduce false positives.

## üß∞ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- NumPy
- Pygame (for sound alarm)
- Kalman Filter (custom implementation)
- ESP32-CAM for live video stream

## üîß Setup Instructions

### 1. Prerequisites

Install the required Python libraries:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy pygame
````

Ensure your ESP32-CAM is streaming video and reachable over a local IP (e.g., `http://192.168.192.102:81/stream`).

---

### 2. Running the Project

Update the IP address of your ESP32 camera in `main()`:

```python
CAMERA_IP = "192.168.192.102"
CAMERA_PORT = 81
```

Then run the script:

```bash
python lane_departure_detector.py
```

## üéØ How It Works

1. **Frame Capture**: Captures video frames from the ESP32-CAM stream.
2. **Preprocessing**: Extracts the Region of Interest (ROI) and applies white color detection in HSV, RGB, LAB, and grayscale.
3. **Lane Detection**: Combines histogram peaks, contours, and Hough lines to find left and right lane lines.
4. **Kalman Filter**: Smoothens the detected positions over time to reduce noise.
5. **Lane Departure Check**: Compares the car's center with lane center; triggers violation count and alarm if deviation is large.
6. **Alarm System**: Plays an audio beep repeatedly when departure is detected.

## üß™ Visualization

* **Green lines**: Detected lane boundaries.
* **Yellow line**: Estimated lane center.
* **Purple shaded area**: Danger zones (outside lane).
* **Text overlay**: Shows departure status and violation count.

## üì∏ ESP32-CAM Setup Tips

Make sure your ESP32-CAM is flashed with the correct firmware and streaming over HTTP. The format should be:

```
http://<CAMERA_IP>:<PORT>/stream
```

You can test the stream with a browser before using it in the script.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings & Notes

* Ensure good lighting and contrast on the road for better lane detection.
* This system is for research/demo purposes and **not** production-ready for real driving environments.
* Alarm may not play if `pygame` has audio device compatibility issues‚Äîensure proper setup.
